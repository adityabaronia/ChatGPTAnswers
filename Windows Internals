the other day i was debugging my application in windwos 10 pro OS. There i saw a kernel32 library loaded in memory. Whoes memory is it is supposed to be? my current process's memory or is that the memory for kernel32.dll intself

When a process loads a dynamic-link library (DLL) like kernel32.dll, the operating system maps the DLL into the process's virtual address space. Each process has its own virtual address space, which is a private area of memory that it can use to store its code, data, and other resources. The virtual address space of a process is divided into pages, and each page can be mapped to physical memory or to a page file on disk.

In the case of kernel32.dll, when it is loaded into a process's virtual address space, it occupies a portion of the process's memory. The memory used by kernel32.dll belongs to the process's virtual address space and is managed by the operating system's memory manager. The memory used by kernel32.dll is typically shared among multiple processes that load the DLL, but each process has its own copy of the DLL's data structures.

So, to answer your question, the memory used by kernel32.dll is part of the process's virtual address space, not a separate memory space for the DLL itself.

 i was debugging my application using windbg preview. at the same time opened new instance of windbg preview and started debugging another application. There i found that address of kernel32.dll is same in both the application that i was debgging. How is it possible that kernel32.dll is at same address in both application

The reason why the address of kernel32.dll is the same in both applications is due to a feature of Windows called Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).

ASLR is a security feature introduced in Windows Vista and later versions that randomizes the base address of executable modules and DLLs loaded into a process's virtual address space. The purpose of ASLR is to make it harder for attackers to exploit memory-related vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, by making it more difficult to predict the location of code and data in memory.

However, ASLR only randomizes the base address of modules when they are loaded into a process's virtual address space. If multiple processes load the same module (in this case, kernel32.dll), and if the operating system assigns the same base address to the module in both processes, then the module will have the same virtual address in both processes.

So, in your case, it's likely that both instances of kernel32.dll were loaded at the same base address in both applications due to the way ASLR works, resulting in the same virtual address for the module in both processes.

does this means kernel32.dll is loaded as many times as an application executes and it is separate for every process

Yes, that's correct. When an application is executed, the operating system loads a separate instance of kernel32.dll into the virtual address space of the process. Each process that uses kernel32.dll has its own separate instance of the DLL in memory, which is managed by the operating system's memory manager.

This means that each process has its own copy of kernel32.dll, and changes made by one process to its copy of the DLL do not affect the copies used by other processes. Each process has its own virtual address space and memory protection mechanisms that prevent it from accessing the memory used by other processes, including the memory used by their copies of kernel32.dll.

This mechanism allows multiple processes to use the same system DLLs, like kernel32.dll, without interfering with each other. It also allows the operating system to update system DLLs without affecting running applications, since each application has its own copy of the DLL in memory.

can you make me understand more about why do same address is allocated to kernel32.dll across different processes in wondows

Sure, I can provide more information on why the same address is allocated to kernel32.dll across different processes in Windows.

When a process loads a dynamic-link library (DLL) like kernel32.dll, the operating system determines where to map the DLL in the process's virtual address space. The location where the DLL is mapped is determined by the memory manager, which uses a process called virtual address space layout randomization (ASLR) to randomize the location of DLLs and other executable code in memory.

ASLR is a security feature that makes it harder for attackers to exploit memory-related vulnerabilities by making it more difficult to predict the location of code and data in memory. When ASLR is enabled, the memory manager randomizes the base address of a DLL each time it is loaded into a process's virtual address space, ensuring that the DLL will be loaded at a different address in each process.

However, for system DLLs like kernel32.dll, the operating system uses a feature called image address space layout randomization (IA-SLR) instead of ASLR. IA-SLR is a variant of ASLR that randomizes the base address of system DLLs across different processes, but not within the same process. This means that the same base address is used for the same system DLL in all processes running on the system.

The reason for using IA-SLR instead of ASLR for system DLLs is to improve system performance and reduce memory usage. By using the same base address for the same system DLL across all processes, the operating system can reduce the amount of physical memory needed to store the DLL, since it only needs to load one copy of the DLL into physical memory and map it into the virtual address space of each process that uses it.

In summary, the same address is allocated to kernel32.dll across different processes in Windows because of a feature called IA-SLR, which randomizes the base address of system DLLs across different processes but not within the same process. This allows the operating system to reduce memory usage and improve system performance by sharing the same copy of the DLL among all processes that use it.

"since it only needs to load one copy of the DLL into physical memory and map it into the virtual address space of each process that uses it."
please make me understand the mapping part in the above statment

Sure! When a process loads a dynamic-link library (DLL) like kernel32.dll, the operating system needs to map the DLL into the process's virtual address space so that the process can access the code and data contained in the DLL.

Mapping a DLL into a process's virtual address space involves two steps: first, the operating system loads the DLL into physical memory and assigns it a base address; then, the operating system maps the DLL into the process's virtual address space by creating a mapping between the base address of the DLL in physical memory and a corresponding virtual address range in the process's virtual address space.

When multiple processes use the same system DLL, like kernel32.dll, the operating system only needs to load the DLL into physical memory once and map it into the virtual address space of each process that uses it. This is possible because the same base address is used for the same system DLL in all processes running on the system, as I explained earlier.

So, when a process loads kernel32.dll, the operating system checks to see if the DLL is already loaded into physical memory. If it is, the operating system creates a new mapping between the base address of the DLL in physical memory and a corresponding virtual address range in the process's virtual address space. This allows the process to access the code and data contained in the DLL as if it were loaded into its own virtual address space.

By sharing the same copy of kernel32.dll among all processes that use it, the operating system can reduce memory usage and improve system performance, since it only needs to load the DLL into physical memory once and map it into the virtual address space of each process that uses it.

why do changing code of kernel32.dll in my address space do not make any change in physical space were kernel32.dll is loaded

When you are debugging a process that has loaded kernel32.dll and you change the code of kernel32.dll in the process's virtual address space, you are actually changing the virtual memory of the process and not the physical memory where kernel32.dll is loaded.

Each process has its own virtual address space, which is a range of addresses that the process uses to access its own code and data as well as any shared libraries (like kernel32.dll) that the process uses. When you modify the code of kernel32.dll in a process's virtual address space, you are modifying the process's own virtual memory, but not the physical memory where kernel32.dll is loaded.

The operating system uses a technique called virtual memory to manage the process's virtual address space and map it to physical memory. Virtual memory allows the operating system to give each process the illusion that it has access to its own contiguous block of memory, even though the physical memory may be fragmented and shared among multiple processes. The operating system manages the mapping between virtual and physical memory using a page table, which is a data structure that keeps track of the mapping between virtual and physical addresses.

When you modify the code of kernel32.dll in a process's virtual address space, the changes are only visible within the process's own virtual address space. The operating system keeps track of these changes in the process's page table and updates the mapping between the virtual and physical memory accordingly. However, the changes are not reflected in the physical memory where kernel32.dll is loaded, because the physical memory is shared among multiple processes and cannot be modified by a single process.

In summary, when you modify the code of kernel32.dll in a process's virtual address space, you are modifying the process's own virtual memory and not the physical memory where kernel32.dll is loaded. The operating system manages the mapping between virtual and physical memory using a page table, which allows each process to have its own virtual address space and the illusion of access to its own contiguous block of memory.

but changing anything in my process reflects changes in physical memory. why?

Changes you make to your process's memory, including its code and data, do not directly affect the physical memory where kernel32.dll is loaded or any other memory used by other processes. However, it is possible that some changes you make to your process's memory can indirectly affect other processes or the operating system as a whole.

For example, if you change the value of a global variable in your process's memory, and that global variable is used by other processes or the operating system itself, then the changes you make could indirectly affect other processes or the operating system. Similarly, if you modify the behavior of a system call or function by patching the code of your process, then the changes you make could affect other processes that call that system call or function.

However, these changes are limited to your process's own virtual memory and do not directly affect the physical memory where kernel32.dll is loaded or any other memory used by other processes. The operating system uses memory protection mechanisms to ensure that each process can only access its own virtual memory and cannot interfere with the virtual memory of other processes or the operating system itself.

So, while you can modify your process's own virtual memory, you cannot directly modify the physical memory where shared libraries like kernel32.dll are loaded, since that memory is shared among multiple processes and protected by the operating system.

can you help me understand logic behind mapping of physical memory on to virtual memoery

Sure, I can explain the logic behind the mapping of physical memory onto virtual memory.

The basic idea behind virtual memory is to provide each process with its own virtual address space, which is independent of the physical memory available in the system. Each process sees a contiguous range of virtual addresses that it can use to access its own code and data, as well as any shared libraries and system resources it needs. The operating system maps the virtual addresses used by a process to the physical addresses in the system's memory using a page table.

The page table is a data structure that maps virtual addresses to physical addresses. Each entry in the page table corresponds to a page of virtual memory, which is typically 4KB in size. The page table contains information about the mapping between the virtual pages and the physical pages, including the physical address of the page in memory, whether the page is readable, writable, or executable, and whether the page is present or not.

When a process accesses a virtual address that is not currently mapped to a physical address, a page fault occurs. The operating system handles the page fault by allocating a physical page of memory, if one is available, and mapping it to the virtual address requested by the process. The page table is updated to reflect the new mapping, and the process can continue executing as if nothing happened.

The advantage of using virtual memory is that it allows the operating system to share physical memory among multiple processes, even if those processes have different memory requirements. For example, if two processes are using the same shared library, the operating system can map the same physical pages of memory to the virtual address spaces of both processes, thus saving memory.

Additionally, virtual memory allows the operating system to protect the memory used by each process from unauthorized access or modification. The page table contains information about the permissions for each page of virtual memory, such as whether it is readable, writable, or executable. The operating system can use this information to enforce memory protection rules and prevent one process from accessing or modifying the memory of another process.

In summary, the mapping of physical memory onto virtual memory is a key feature of modern operating systems that allows multiple processes to share physical memory while protecting their own memory from unauthorized access or modification. The page table is the data structure used by the operating system to manage this mapping and enforce memory protection rules.
